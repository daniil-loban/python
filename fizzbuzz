# FizzBuzz is the classic basic programming challenge.
# program that prints the numbers from 1 to 50, 
# but for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number 
# and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. 
# For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.

def fizzbuzz(number):
	result = ('Fizz' if number%3==0 else '') + ( 'Buzz' if (number%5==0)  else '')
	if result =='':
		return number
	else:
		return result


for i in range(1, 51):
	print(fizzbuzz2(i))
